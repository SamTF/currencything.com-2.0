# Svelte Frontend

This is the actual website. The layout, the UI, interactivity, the page routes, and the data-fetching is all powered by SvelteKit. Most of the website is rendered server-side, but it feature a lot of client-side interactivity with filtering and sorting, fetching new data, and cool sound effects.

The only other packages used are dateformat for displaying dates, and adaptor-node for running this as a node.js server.

Not sure what else to say, kinda just writing this to get rid of the default readme file. Check out the main readme file or [my website](https://sam.freelancepolice.org) if you want to learn more.
